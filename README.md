# ProvewCodeChallenge
Source code in C# for Proview's code challenge

##The problem
I encounter this challenge while surfing the web, read the whole challenge here. The problem is quite simple but since I was reading about Repository Pattern and Unit Of Work. 
I decided to give it a try.

##The technical
I applied quite a few techniques here:

* MVC 5 with Entity Framework 6
* Repository Design Pattern with Unit Of Work
* Angular JS with many modules like paging, searching, auto showing ajax loading icon, global message service, global confirm modal service...

If you by any chance read about my work here and feel like you can customize it to your need, feel free to give it a go and if possible, say hi to me at sasssyboy224 at gmail dot com
